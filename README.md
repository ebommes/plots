# Plots

After years of using base R to create plots, I am planning to switch to ggplot2 and its grammar of graphic.
However, I am not a big fan of the standard theme:

Hence, I created a very basic theme that is suitable for my needs: It looks good, whether it is printed, on a computer screen or projected on a wall. Also, there are no distracting lines in the default modus. 

dark colors (default)

light colors

Grid lines or a panel can be added, if needed:
